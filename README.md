### Hi there 👋

Hello world 🌍! I'm Breno Ribeiro do Val.
A lifelong learner living a simple life!

In 2018, I have decided to change my career path, focusing on software development. Since then, I have been always looking for new challenges and get to knowing the buzzling technologies.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a full-stack engineer, using ReactJS, Next.js, React Native, Node.js and Python. Also, using AWS as a cloud provider.
- 🚀 Strong background in Front-end, I have worked with AngularJs, Angular 2+, React, Next.js, and React Native for Mobile Apps.
- 💬 Talk to me about economy, technology and cookery.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have taken Steve Jobs' phrase "Stay hungry, stay foolish" as a precept.
